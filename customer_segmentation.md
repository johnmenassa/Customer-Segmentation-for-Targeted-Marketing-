Customer Segmentation Analysis in E-Commerce
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an E-commerce dataset to identify distinct customer segments. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies more effectively and enhance customer engagement. The project is rooted in predictive analytics, utilizing a comprehensive set of Python libraries to process, analyze, and visualize data, leading to actionable insights on customer behavior.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The project leverages the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
Scipy: Used for scientific and technical computing.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
NLTK & WordCloud: Text processing and word cloud generation.
Installation
To set up your environment, you can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud
Running the Project
The analysis is encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook named Cust_segmentation_online_retail.ipynb. Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to open the .ipynb file.

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/project/directory
jupyter notebook
Once Jupyter is running, navigate to the notebook file and execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
